## How To Add Transactions
- Add a text label for your expense (e.g. payment)
- Add an amount, for negative numbers use (-) (e.g. 500)
- Click "Add Transaction"

The application will automatically convert your amount into a money format that can then be added or subtracted from your balance total

## Transaction History
All transaction history is tracked with both your text label and amount.
Each transaction is labeled either green for positive amounts or red for negative amounts
Each transaction can also be removed at any time by hovering over it and clicking the 'x'
